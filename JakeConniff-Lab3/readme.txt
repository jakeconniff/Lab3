Lab 3

What I added:
- Save to photos: The bar button in the top left corner of the screen labelled ‘Save to Photos’ saves a photo of the work in the DrawingView to the phone’s gallery
- Shape opactiy: The slider above the color selecting buttons can be slid left or right to change the opacity of the next shape you draw


How I added:
For save to photos, I had to search online and in the Swift documentation for how to add a photo to the phone library, as well as adding a button in the nav bar above to implement functionality. When I first tried the code, I got an error about privacy access, leading to a google search of what to do about privacy access which led me to implementing a key on the items file. While the final product isn’t extensive in coding length, it was decently technical and took a bit to try to get it to work. 

For the shape opacity, I knew that was related to alpha, so I searched through documentation to determine how to adjust a color’s opacity without having to add that as a parameter at color creation for simplicity. From there, I used my knowledge from earlier in the semester to implement a slider input on the screen for functionality, and then set constraints on the object to avoid it overlapping with the other objects on the screen. The work for this portion took a decent amount of knowledge acquired over my time building apps for this class, as well as it taught me a new asset in terms of UIColor.


Why I added:
- Shape opacity: Initially, I added it because I had a slight idea on where to start with my implementation because of my previous knowledge about the existence of alpha value. After that, I thought about the cool effects you could get by layering different colors and different opacities, and it came out really cool. It adds a layer to the complexity of the images that you can build, making the app more interesting and fun
- Save to photos: While it was one of the suggested features to implement, I also just thought it would be cool to share the things that you make on the app with your friends, especially once I got the implementation of the color opacity. It also is a pretty standard feature in most “art-making” apps today.
